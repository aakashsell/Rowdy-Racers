# Term Project Poject Proposal

By Aakash Sell

## Project Description

My project is going to be called Rowdy Racers. In this game players are going to race against ai racers on a series of pre-made, precedurally generated, and player made tracks. The default mode will be a single player game in which the player will race against ai. The other two modes will consist of arcade mode in which the player will drive forever until they crash or sustain too much damage. The third gamemode will be a 1v1 mode in which two player will race solely against one another. All of the previous modes will also be available with a 2 player mode.

The track generator will be a screen in which the user will be able to draw a line on their screen with a mouse and that will be turned into a playable track by the game.

## Competitive Analysis
My game is a top down 2d car racing game which was very popular during the early era of arcade games.

## Structural Plan

This project will use modes in that whenever a different aspect of the game is shown, a separate mode will be used. 

## Algorithmic Plan

## Timeline Plan

## Version Control Plan

I plan on using GitHub to backup and store my code. This will be stored on the GitHub servers and will not be stored on my local device.
