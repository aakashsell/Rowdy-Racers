# Rowdy Racers

## Project Description

My project is going to be called Rowdy Racers. In this game players are going to race against ai
racers on a series of pre-made and player made tracks. The default mode will be a single player
game in which the player will race against ai. The other two modes will consist of arcade mode
in which the player will drive forever until they crash or sustain too much damage. The third
game mode will be a 1v1 mode in which two players will race solely against one another. All of
the previous modes will also be available with a 2-player mode.

## Running the Project

To run the project all that is needed is to simply run the main.py file with 
python v3.9.  There is nothing else that needs to be setup.

## Libraries

I did not use any additional libraries other than pygame for music. This is automatically
installed by python when the game is first run. Other than this I used standard libraries 
used in 15-112 such as math and random.

## Commands

A majority of the app just uses buttons with cooresponding key presses that are stated on the buttons.
The only command that I used that is not clearly stated is pressing the "p" key from any screen will
take the user back to the start screen.

The player's horizontal movement is controlled by the left and right arrows and you can 
boost with the up arrow. When 2 player mode is active player two can move horizontal with a and d and boost
with w.
